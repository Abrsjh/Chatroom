## Usage Instructions

1. **Start each task** by copying the exact prompt into Claude Code
2. **Follow TDD approach** - write failing tests first, then implementation
3. **Mark completed tasks** with ✅ in this file
4. **Update memory-bank files** as context changes
5. **Test thoroughly** before moving to next task
6. **Never run system commands** - only generate code files
